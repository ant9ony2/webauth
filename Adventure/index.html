<h1 style="color:purple;font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;text-align:center"">Visit to <strong>Eiffel Tower</strong><h1>
<dt>October 14, 2018</dt>
<dd style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">I visited the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Unluckily it rained that day so I had to bring an umbrella. The eiffel tower is a lot bigger than I thought it was. It took hours to walk up the step on the eiffel tower. The view at the top definitely made it worth it though.</dd>

<h1 style="color:rgb(205, 60, 50);font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;text-align:center"">Visit to <i>Queen's Apartments</i><h1>
<dt>October 15, 2018</dt>
<dd style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Image The next day I decided to visit the Queen's Apartments. It was very pretty and a lot larger on the inside than it looked on the outside. As I was touring the inside of the buildings, a guide informed me that the project of Haussmannization was the reason for this building's construction. My feet hurt a lot after walking around so much.</dd>

<h1 style="color: black;text-align: center;">Visit to the <mark>Royal Chapel</mark><h1>
<dt>October 16, 2018</dt>
<dd style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Image The next day, as I was traveling to the Royal Chapel, I was called a Flâneu, which apparently means traveler. When I got to the Royal Chapel I was stunned by the beautiful architecture of the building. The inside was even better, it was so large I almost felt uncomfortable. This has been my favorite destination so far.
